# Post_Pruning_DecisionTree
DecisionTreeClassifier provides parameters such as min_samples_leaf and max_depth to prevent a tree from overfiting. Cost complexity pruning provides another option to control the size of a tree. In DecisionTreeClassifier, this pruning technique is parameterized by the cost complexity parameter, ccp_alpha. Greater values of ccp_alpha increase the number of nodes pruned. Here we only show the effect of ccp_alpha on regularizing the trees and how to choose a ccp_alpha based on validation scores.
